# Canvas
I have attached a file which contains features like :
      1. Dragging the bounding box control should transform the text layout and perform word-wrap.
      2. User can move the text object in canvas, rotate, scale, delete.
      3. User can create multiple text boxes.
      4. All the above features is also available if the object is image.
